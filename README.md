Event chart is a Joomla front end module, to be used with Joomla Events Booking.
It displays a line graph of cumulative registrants with respect to the registration date, where the horizontal axis is in days with respect to the start of the event.

Currently in testing stage, use with caution.

Usage:
After install, go to Website Modules, and setup the module by giving your default filters. Place your module where you need it. Enjoy!

Remarks on use or bugs can be placed in the github issues, no guaranty I can work on it though.
